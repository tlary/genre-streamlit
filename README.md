This Repo contains code for a short Deep Learning App which takes (German) song lyrics as input and classifies it into one of three genre categories: Hip-Hop, German Pop, or German Schlager.

The model is built with the fastai library ([see this repo](https://github.com/tlary/music-genre-classifier)), the app is created with streamlit and deployed with streamlit share.
